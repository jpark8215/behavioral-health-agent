    "transcript": "Dr. Evans: Hi Chloe, good to see you again. How has your week been since we last spoke?\n\nChloe: Hi, Dr. Evans. It’s been… okay. A bit of a roller coaster. I had that big presentation at work on Wednesday, and I was a mess leading up to it.\n\nDr. Evans: Tell me more about that. What did \"a mess\" feel like?\n\nChloe: Just... constant dread. My stomach was in knots. I couldn't sleep Monday or Tuesday night. I just kept replaying all the ways it could go wrong. I'd be typing an email and my brain would just interrupt with, \"You're going to forget your talking points,\" or \"The client is going to think your ideas are stupid.\"\n\nDr. Evans: It sounds incredibly draining to be battling those thoughts while also trying to do your job. When you had the thought, \"The client is going to think your ideas are stupid,\" what was the immediate feeling that came with it?\n\nChloe: Panic. A hot, sharp feeling in my chest. And a feeling of... embarrassment, almost? Like I was embarrassed for something that hadn't even happened.\n\nDr. Evans: That's a powerful combination of physical and emotional reactions. This is a great example of what we've been calling \"catastrophizing\"—your mind jumping to the worst-case scenario. Let's try to challenge that thought. What evidence did you have that the client would think your ideas were stupid?\n\nChloe: I mean... none, really. They've always been positive about my work before. But my mind doesn't listen to that. It just fixates on the possibility of failure.\n\nDr. Evans: Right, because the anxious part of your brain is trying to protect you by preparing for the worst. But in the process, it's causing you significant distress. So, how did the presentation actually go?\n\nChloe: (A small smile) It went really well, actually. They loved the new campaign concept. My boss even took me aside afterward to congratulate me.\n\nDr. Evans: That's wonderful to hear. So we have a piece of concrete evidence to hold up against the anxious thought. The thought was, \"They will think my ideas are stupid.\" The reality was, \"They loved my ideas.\" Can you see the disconnect there?\n\nChloe: Yeah, it seems so obvious now. But in the moment, the fear feels so much more real than the logic.\n\nDr. Evans: And that's completely normal. The goal isn't to never have an anxious thought again. It's to learn how to notice it, pause, and question it, rather than letting it spiral. For next week, let's try this: when you catch yourself worrying, I want you to write down the specific worry. Then, just like we did now, write down one piece of evidence that supports the worry, and one piece that challenges it. It’s about building that muscle of challenging your own thoughts.\n\nChloe: Okay. I can try that. It feels a bit like homework, but I see how it could help.\n\nDr. Evans: Exactly. It's practice. You did the hard part on Wednesday and you succeeded. Now we just need to help your brain catch up with your actual capabilities.",

    "transcript": "Dr. Sharma: Hello David. Thank you for coming in today. How are you feeling?\n\nDavid: (Sighs heavily) About the same, I suppose. Empty. The house is just so... quiet. I still expect to hear her call my name from the other room. It's been six months, and it feels like it happened yesterday.\n\nDr. Sharma: The silence can be deafening after a lifetime of partnership. It sounds like her presence is still very much a part of your home.\n\nDavid: It is. Her reading glasses are still on the nightstand. I haven't moved them. Her coat is still on the hook by the door. My daughter, Jessica, says I should pack some things up, that it would help me \"move on.\" I got so angry with her.\n\nDr. Sharma: It’s understandable you’d feel angry. To you, what does the phrase \"move on\" feel like it means?\n\nDavid: It feels like forgetting her. Like erasing her. Like saying the last 40 years didn't matter. She wasn't just a chapter in my life; she was the book. Packing up her things feels like a betrayal.\n\nDr. Sharma: Thank you for sharing that. It makes perfect sense that you would want to protect her memory and the life you built. There is no timeline for grief, and you have every right to keep her things where they are for as long as you need. Grief isn't about moving on, but about moving forward with the person's memory integrated into you.\n\nDavid: I just… I don't know how to do that. Last weekend, my grandson scored a goal in his soccer game. I smiled, and for a second, I felt happy for him. And then this wave of guilt just washed over me. How can I feel happy when she's gone? It felt wrong.\n\nDr. Sharma: That feeling of guilt is so common, David. It’s a testament to how much you love her. But I want you to consider something. If Martha were sitting here with us, what would she say about you feeling a moment of joy watching your grandson?\n\nDavid: (Pauses, looks down) She would have been thrilled. She would have elbowed me in the ribs and said, \"Isn't he fantastic?\" She would have wanted me to be there, to be smiling.\n\nDr. Sharma: It sounds like allowing yourself those moments of joy isn't a betrayal of her, but perhaps a way of honoring her. Honoring the life and the family that you both created together.\n\nDavid: I... I hadn't thought of it that way. It's just so hard.\n\nDr. Sharma: It is incredibly hard. And you don't have to force it. For now, let's just sit with that idea. That joy and grief can exist at the same time. They don't cancel each other out. One doesn't diminish the other.",

    "transcript": "Dr. Chen: Liam, Olivia, welcome. Last week we started talking about the cycle you both get into during arguments. Olivia, you mentioned feeling like you have to get louder to be heard, and Liam, you said you shut down because you feel attacked. Did an instance of this come up this past week?\n\nOlivia: (Crosses her arms) Did it ever. Thursday night. About the credit card bill. I brought it up calmly, I really did. I just said, \"Hey, the bill is higher than we discussed, what happened?\" And right away, he got that look on his face.\n\nDr. Chen: Liam, what was that look? What were you feeling when Olivia brought up the bill?\n\nLiam: Here we go again. That's what I was feeling. It's never just a question. It's an accusation. My shoulders tense up. I feel like I'm already on trial and I haven't even said anything. So, yes, I probably shut down. I went quiet. What's the point of talking when I'm already the bad guy?\n\nOlivia: See! That's what he does. He just checks out. He leaves me alone in the conversation. I'm trying to solve a problem for us, for our finances, and he acts like I'm personally attacking him. So yeah, my voice gets a little louder. I get frustrated because I feel like I'm talking to a brick wall.\n\nDr. Chen: Okay, let's pause the replay here. This is the cycle right here. Olivia, when you bring up a concern, your underlying need is to feel like you're a team, working together to solve a problem. Is that accurate?\n\nOlivia: Yes, exactly!\n\nDr. Chen: And when you feel that Liam is withdrawing, the fear beneath the frustration is that you're alone in this partnership. That you have to manage everything by yourself.\n\nOlivia: (Voice softens) Yes. That's it. It feels very lonely.\n\nDr. Chen: Thank you. Now, Liam. When Olivia brings up an issue, even calmly, you hear it as criticism. The feeling you described is one of being pre-judged. What's the fear under that? What are you afraid is going to happen?\n\nLiam: (Takes a deep breath) That I'm failing. That I'm not a good enough husband or provider. That I've disappointed her again. And it's easier to just... not engage than to sit there and feel like a failure.\n\nDr. Chen: So, Olivia's escalation is a protest against feeling disconnected and alone. Liam's withdrawal is a defense against feeling inadequate and judged. Can you both see how you're each reacting to a deeper fear, and not just to the words being said?\n\nLiam: I... I never thought of her getting loud as her feeling lonely. I always just saw it as anger directed at me.\n\nOlivia: And I never thought of you going quiet as you feeling like a failure. I just thought you didn't care.\n\nDr. Chen: This is the core of the work. Learning to speak from that deeper place and learning to hear what the other is truly feeling. For this next week, I'm not asking you to solve any big problems. I'm just asking you to try and identify the feeling underneath. If an argument starts, try saying, \"I'm feeling judged right now,\" or \"I'm feeling alone in this.\" Let's see if speaking the language of emotion, rather than accusation, can begin to change the cycle.",

    "transcript": "Dr. Rossi: Hi Ethan, come on in. Good to see you. How have things been since our last session?\n\nEthan: Hi, Dr. Rossi. Thanks. Um, they’ve been a mix. The promotion is still… a lot. I tried what we talked about last week—the idea of just noticing the anxious thoughts instead of immediately wrestling with them. It’s harder than it sounds.\n\nDr. Rossi: It's a very different way of relating to your mind, so it's bound to feel difficult at first. It's like learning a new language. Was there a specific situation this week where this was particularly challenging?\n\nEthan: Yeah, definitely. On Monday, my new boss insisted the whole design team go out for a \"welcome lunch\" for me. It was supposed to be a nice gesture, but honestly, it was my worst nightmare. I almost called in sick.\n\nDr. Rossi: That sounds incredibly stressful. A mandatory social event where you're the center of attention. Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like a perfect, if difficult, situation to explore more deeply today. Would you be open to unpacking that lunch experience with me?\n\nEthan: Yeah, okay. I feel like I need to. I’ve just been replaying it in my head all week.\n\nDr. Rossi: Okay. Let’s go there then. Take me back to Monday. When did the anxiety first start to ramp up?\n\nEthan: The moment the email came through in the morning. \"Team Lunch at noon to celebrate Ethan!\" Instantly, my heart started pounding. My palms got sweaty right there at my desk. It felt like a summons, not a celebration. All I could think about was having to make small talk for an hour with six other people whose work I now have to manage.\n\nDr. Rossi: So the physical symptoms started immediately, triggered by the anticipation. Let's fast forward to the restaurant. You're all sitting at the table. Can you remember a specific moment when the anxiety peaked?\n\nEthan: (Nods, looking down at his hands) Yeah. My boss, Sarah, said, \"So Ethan, tell everyone a little bit about your vision for the team.\" And all eyes turned to me. It felt like the air got sucked out of the room. My mind just went completely blank. All the intelligent, competent things I'd thought about before were just... gone.\n\nDr. Rossi: That sounds like a high-pressure moment. A spotlight moment. When your mind went blank, what were the thoughts that rushed in to fill that space? What was your internal monologue saying?\n\nEthan: It was loud. It was just this chorus of, \"Don't say something stupid. You sound like a kid. They're all thinking 'why him?'. They all know more than you do. You're a fraud and they're about to find out. This is it. This is where they see you don't belong here.\"\n\nDr. Rossi: \"You're a fraud and they're about to find out.\" That sounds like a powerful and painful thought. In cognitive therapy, we call that specific thought pattern \"impostor syndrome.\" It's the core belief that your successes are due to luck, not talent, and you're constantly afraid of being exposed. Does that resonate?\n\nEthan: One hundred percent. That's the thought that runs my life. And in that moment, at the table, I believed it with every fiber of my being.\n\nDr. Rossi: So you had the thought, \"I'm a fraud,\" and you felt intense anxiety. What did you do? How did you behave in that moment?\n\nEthan: I kind of stammered. I think I said something really generic and clichéd, like, \"Uh, well, I'm just really excited to, you know, leverage our synergies and foster a collaborative environment.\" I cringed as soon as I said it. It sounded like corporate nonsense. I avoided eye contact and just pushed some food around on my plate for the rest of the meal, hoping no one would ask me another direct question. I just wanted to disappear.\n\nDr. Rossi: Okay, this is really useful, Ethan. You've perfectly described the cycle. The trigger—being put on the spot. The thoughts—the \"I'm a fraud\" story. The feelings—intense anxiety, panic. And the behavior—stammering, avoiding eye contact, and withdrawing. The behavior is an attempt to make the thoughts and feelings go away, right? To escape the situation.\n\nEthan: Exactly. I just wanted it to be over.\n\nDr. Rossi: The problem is, as you've seen, this withdrawal only reinforces the belief that you can't handle it, making the next time feel even more daunting. So, let’s try a small experiment right here, if you're willing.\n\nEthan: (Hesitantly) Okay.\n\nDr. Rossi: I want you to bring that core thought to mind. The big one. \"I am a fraud.\" Say it out loud.\n\nEthan: (Quietly) \"I am a fraud.\"\n\nDr. Rossi: Okay. Now, notice what happens in your body when you say it. Any tension? Any sensations?\n\nEthan: My chest feels tight. It's the same feeling from the restaurant.\n\nDr. Rossi: Got it. Now, let's try something different. I want you to say the exact same thing, but add a simple phrase to the beginning. I want you to say, \"I'm having the thought that I am a fraud.\"\n\nEthan: (Pauses, then says it more clearly) \"I'm having the thought that I am a fraud.\"\n\nDr. Rossi: Good. Now say it one more time, adding another layer. \"I am noticing that I'm having the thought that I am a fraud.\"\n\nEthan: \"I am noticing that I'm having the thought that I am a fraud.\"\n\nDr. Rossi: Okay. Take a breath. What do you notice? What's the difference between \"I am a fraud\" and \"I am noticing I'm having the thought that I am a fraud\"?\n\nEthan: (Thinks for a moment) It… it feels less like a fact. The first way feels like a truth I'm announcing. The second way feels like I'm just describing something that's happening in my head. There's more… distance. The tightness in my chest is still there, but it's maybe a little less intense.\n\nDr. Rossi: Exactly. You've just created distance. That's the goal. This is a technique we call \"defusion.\" You're not trying to argue with the thought or get rid of it. You're unhooking from it. You're seeing it for what it is: just a string of words your brain produced. It's not a command, and it's not a fundamental truth about you. It's like the weather of your mind—it's cloudy right now, but you are not the clouds. You are the sky.\n\nEthan: The sky... I like that metaphor.\n\nDr. Rossi: It's about creating enough space between you and your thoughts so that they don't have control over your actions. So, let's go back to that lunch. Imagine if, when your boss asked you that question, you could have noticed the thought \"I'm a fraud\" come up, but you didn't have to let it drive the car. If you could have just let that thought be there in the background, what might you have done differently? What kind of leader do you want to be in that moment?\n\nEthan: I'd want to be calm. I'd want to connect with my team. I would have said something genuine, like, \"Honestly, my first goal is just to listen to all of you. You're the ones who have been doing this amazing work, and I want to learn what you need from me to do your jobs even better.\" Something like that.\n\nDr. Rossi: That sounds like a confident, collaborative, and authentic leader. Notice how that answer is aligned with your values, not with your fear. The goal isn't to go into the next team lunch without anxiety. The anxiety will probably show up. It's a passenger that's been with you a long time. The goal is to let it sit in the passenger seat, while you, the authentic Ethan, keeps your hands on the steering wheel, driving toward the kind of leader you value being.\n\nEthan: So I just let the anxiety be there? And do the thing I want to do anyway?\n\nDr. Rossi: You let it be there, you notice it, you label the thoughts it brings with it, and then you bring your focus back to what matters to you in that moment. It takes practice. For this coming week, I'd like you to try just that. Not in a big, scary situation like a team lunch, but in small moments. When a self-critical thought pops up, I want you to practice that phrasing: \"I'm noticing I'm having the thought that...\" Just label it. Don't fight it, don't judge it. Just notice it. That's the first step to taking its power away.\n\nEthan: Okay. Just noticing. I can do that. It feels more manageable than trying to win an argument with my own brain.\n\nDr. Rossi: Exactly. We're not looking for a fight; we're looking for freedom. We'll pick up here next week.",

At all. Except to use the bathroom. I watched the clock. 10 AM, 1 PM, 4 PM. My sister texted, I saw her name, and I just... I couldn't. I felt so guilty. I felt like such a failure. I'm 34 years old and I can't even sit up. It’s pathetic.\n\nDr. Thorne: Let's pause on that word, \"pathetic.\" That's a very powerful judgment. What you're describing—the exhaustion, the inability to move, the lack of will—those aren't character flaws, Ben. Those are the symptoms of depression. The same way a cough is a symptom of a cold. When you’re lying there at 1 PM, and the thought \"I'm pathetic\" comes, what does that thought do to your mood?\n\nBen: (Thinks) It just... sinks it. It's like a weight. It's the proof. It proves that I'm useless, so what's the point of getting up anyway? It just confirms it.\n\nDr. Thorne: Right. So the thought \"I'm pathetic\" leads to the feeling of hopelessness, which then leads to the behavior of staying in bed, which then feeds the thought \"See? I'm pathetic.\"\n\nBen: (Nods) It's a loop.\n\nDr. Thorne: It’s the perfect, miserable loop. And it's incredibly strong. We’ve talked about this before—it’s the trap of depression. It convinces you that you have to wait for motivation to arrive before you can do anything. We have to work on the idea of acting before the motivation shows up. We have to do the opposite of what the depression is telling you to do.\n\nBen: I know. I know we talked about it. But you don't understand. It's not just \"I don't feel like it.\" It's like my limbs are filled with wet sand. It’s a physical impossibility.\n\nDr. Thorne: I believe you. I'm not discounting the intensity of that feeling. So let's not aim for \"run a marathon.\" Let's not even aim for \"clean the house.\" Let's aim for the smallest possible action that breaks the cycle. Last week, we filled out that \"Values and Activities\" worksheet. Do you remember any of the things you listed under \"Pleasure\" or \"Mastery\"?\n\nBen: (Sighs) I don't... I think I wrote down \"reading\" and \"playing guitar.\" Which is a joke. I can't focus enough to read a paragraph, and my guitar is just... it just sits there, making me feel guilty.\n\nDr. Thorne: Okay. So \"reading\" and \"playing guitar\" feel like mountains right now. I get that. Let's break it down further. What's one tiny piece of one of those?\n\nBen: I don't know.\n\nDr. Thorne: Let's take the guitar. What's the first step to playing it?\n\nBen: ...Taking it out of the case.\n\nDr. Thorne: Okay. And what's the step before that?\n\nBen: (Looks confused) ...Looking at the case?\n\nDr. Thorne: (Smiles gently) Exactly. What if, tomorrow, the only goal was to sit on the edge of your bed and look at the guitar case for one minute? No pressure to open it. No pressure to play it. Just to look at it. How does that feel, as a task?\n\nBen: It feels... stupid. What's the point of that?\n\nDr. Thorne: The point isn't to become a musician again tomorrow. The point is to do one thing your depression is telling you not to do. The point is to introduce a new behavior. The goal is to have a \"win.\" Right now, the depression is winning 100-0. We're just trying to get one point on the board.\n\nBen: (Stays silent for a moment) I guess I could do that. It just feels so small.\n\nDr. Thorne: Small is the whole point. We're not trying to change your mood. We're trying to change your behavior. The mood will follow, eventually. It lags behind. So, let's make a plan. We're going to call it an experiment. Tomorrow, at, say, 11 AM. What are you usually doing?\n\nBen: Lying in bed, scrolling on my phone, or just staring at the ceiling.\n\nDr. Thorne: Okay. So at 11 AM tomorrow, the experiment is:\n\nSit up on the edge of the bed.\n\nPut your feet on the floor.\n\nLook at the guitar case for 60 seconds.\n\nAfter the 60 seconds, you are 100% free to lie back down. Mission accomplished.\n\nHow does that sound?\n\nBen: (A tiny shrug) I can... I can try. What about the \"reading\" one?\n\nDr. Thorne: Same principle. You loved libraries. You loved the feel of books. What if the goal isn't to read a book, but just to pick one up? Pick up a book you used to love, open it to a random page, and read one sentence. Just one. Then you can put it down.\n\nBen: One sentence.\n\nDr. Thorne: One sentence. These are not \"fixes,\" Ben. These are tiny acts of defiance against the fog. This is what we call Behavioral Activation. We're scheduling activities. The depression wants you to be passive. We're going to be, even in a tiny way, active. I want you to have this plan for the next three days. One \"guitar\" task, one \"reading\" task. And one more. A \"Mastery\" task. Something simple, like brushing your teeth or putting a dish in the dishwasher.\n\nBen: So my goal for Wednesday is... look at my guitar, read one sentence, and brush my teeth?\n\nDr. Thorne: And then, most importantly, I want you to write down that you did it. On that log we made. Not \"did I enjoy it?\" Not \"did it make me feel better?\" Just a checkmark: \"Completed.\" We're gathering data that you can do things, even when you feel awful. We are building evidence against the \"I'm pathetic\" thought.\n\nBen: (Nods slowly) Okay. Okay, I can... I'll try that. It feels a little less impossible.\n\nDr. Thorne: That's all we're aiming for. \"A little less impossible.\" You're doing the hardest work there is right now, Ben. You're fighting a battle no one else can see. These small steps are how we build a path out.",

    "transcript": "Dr. Gupta: Welcome back, Chloe, James. I'd like to start just by checking in. What was the climate like at home this past week? What was the hardest moment?\n\nChloe: (Sharp laugh) Hardest moment? It's just one long hard moment. It's... awful. It's like I'm living with a stranger who I'm also supposed to hate, but also... (her voice breaks) I don't even know. It's just awful.\n\nJames: (Sighs) It was... tense. I'm trying. I really am. I'm doing everything I said I would. I'm home on time, my phone is on the table, I've shared all my passwords. But it doesn't matter. Anything sets her off. On Thursday, I got a text, and she just... she flinched. Like I'd hit her. It was just my boss.\n\nChloe: You say it was just your boss. How am I supposed to know? How am I ever supposed to know anything again? You looked me in the eye for six months, James. Six. Months. And you lied. Every day. So don't you sit there and act frustrated that I don't believe you now. You burned down the whole house, and you're annoyed that I'm cold.\n\nJames: I'm not annoyed! I'm... I'm just... I don't know what else to do. I've apologized. I've ended it. I'm here. I'm in therapy. I'm doing the work. What else do you want from me? I can't build a time machine!\n\nDr. Gupta: Okay, let's pause. This is it. This is the cycle we identified last week. Chloe, you feel a spike of fear—the trauma of the discovery. It comes out as an accusation, an attack. \"How can I believe you?\"\n\nChloe: It's not an attack. It's a fact.\n\nDr. Gupta: It's your truth. It's your reality right now, and it's completely valid. And James, you hear that attack, and your immediate reaction is to get defensive. \"I'm trying! What more can I do?\" And when you get defensive, what does that feel like to you, Chloe?\n\nChloe: It feels like... it feels like he's defending himself. He's not protecting me. He's not getting it. He's worried about how he looks, not about the fact that I'm... I'm bleeding out on the floor. He's impatient. He wants me to be \"over it.\"\n\nDr. Gupta: Is that right, James? Do you want her to just be \"over it\"?\n\nJames: No! God, no. I just... I want her to see that I'm trying. When she looks at me like I'm... like I'm a monster... it makes me want to just... shut down. What's the point? I'll never be \"James\" again. I'll just be \"the guy who had the affair.\"\n\nDr. Gupta: So you're in a cycle. Chloe's fear comes out as anger. James's shame comes out as defensiveness. The anger makes James retreat, and the retreat confirms Chloe's worst fear: that he's not really here, that he's hiding, that she's alone in this. And the cycle spins, and you both get more and more distant, even while sitting in the same room. Is that right?\n\nDr. Gupta: We have to break this cycle. And it requires something incredibly difficult from both of you. James, it starts with you. You have to learn to stop being defensive. When Chloe is launching at you, you are hearing her anger, but you are missing her pain. Her anger is the armor for her agony.\n\nJames: But what am I supposed to say? When she says \"How can I ever trust you?\" What's the right answer? There isn't one.\n\nDr. Gupta: The answer isn't a defense. The answer is to move toward her pain. Instead of \"I'm trying,\" what if you said, \"You're right. You have every reason not to trust me right now. I know I've destroyed your sense of safety, and I can see how scared you are.\"\n\nJames: (Looks down) That feels... hard. It feels like just... taking it.\n\nDr. Gupta: You are taking it. You are taking the consequences of your actions. You are absorbing the blow, James, so that she can stop swinging. You are, in effect, standing there and proving you're not going to run away this time. You are choosing to stand in the fire with her, instead of running for cover.\n\nChloe: (Watching him, her expression softening slightly) I just want to know he gets it. I want to know he understands what he broke. He talks about \"the mistake\" like it was a bad investment. He doesn't get that he... he killed us. The \"us\" we were. It's dead.\n\nDr. Gupta: Chloe, can you turn to him and tell him what you're most afraid of? Not the anger, not the accusation. What is the raw fear underneath?\n\nChloe: (Takes a shaky breath. Looks at James.) I'm afraid... that you'll do it again. That I'm not enough. That I was never enough. I'm afraid that I'm a fool for even sitting here. I'm afraid I'm wasting my time and that the woman I was for 15 years... the happy, confident woman... she's gone forever. And you killed her.\n\n(The room is silent. James is visibly moved, tears in his eyes.)\n\nJames: (Voice thick) I... I hear that. I... (he looks at Dr. Gupta, who nods encouragingly) ...I did that. Chlo, I... I know I did. And I hate myself for it. You are enough. You were always... you were always everything. It wasn't about you. It was about... me. It was about me being stupid, and lonely, and... and a coward. It was me, not you. And I am so, so sorry that I put that fear in you.\n\nDr. Gupta: Stay here, both of you. This is the first time you've broken the cycle. Chloe, you shared the raw vulnerability. James, you met it with remorse and accountability, not defensiveness. How does it feel, just in this second, to be in this conversation, instead of the other one?\n\nChloe: (Wiping her eyes) It's... quieter. It still hurts. But it's... it feels more real.\n\nJames: I just... I want to fix this. I'll do anything.\n\nDr. Gupta: This is the \"anything,\" James. The \"anything\" isn't just transparency. It's this. It's emotional attunement. It's hearing her pain and not making it about your shame. And Chloe, the work for you... and it's not fair, I know... is to try, little by little, to let him. To see that he is staying. To see that he is choosing to sit here and be accountable.\n\nChloe: I don't know if I can.\n\nDr. Gupta: You don't have to today. Today, you just did. And that's where we'll start. For this week, James, your only job when Chloe is activated is to say, \"I hear you. I see how much I've hurt you. I'm not going anywhere.\" No \"buts.\" No \"I'm trying.\" Just that. And Chloe, your job is to try... just once... to say \"I'm feeling scared\" instead of \"What are you hiding?\" We're changing the script, one line at a time.",
